## Description

**Food Recipe Book** is an interactive web project designed to provide users with an easy and organized way to browse a collection of recipes through a clean, simple, and user-friendly interface. The application is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and runs entirely on the client side without the need for databases or a backend server. It demonstrates a complete front-end workflow and reflects the ability to build a functional dynamic website using core web technologies.

The application allows users to explore multiple recipes, preview ingredients, navigate to a detailed recipe page, and read step-by-step instructions. The project emphasizes responsive design, DOM manipulation, and structured data handling within JavaScript.

## Project Functionality

### 1. Recipe List
The homepage features a list of recipes displayed as **cards**, each containing:

- A dish image  
- Recipe title  
- A short preview of ingredients  
- A **“View Recipe”** button for opening detailed instructions  

The cards are arranged in a clean grid layout, allowing users to browse several recipes easily with consistent spacing and visual balance.

### 2. Recipe Details Pages
When a recipe card is clicked, the user is taken to a separate dynamic details page that includes:

- A full list of ingredients  
- Step-by-step cooking instructions  
- Helpful cooking notes and tips  
- A clean and focused layout for easy reading  

All recipe pages are generated dynamically using JavaScript based on structured data stored in arrays/objects.

### 3. Navigation
Navigation throughout the site is smooth and user-friendly, allowing users to:

- Return from a recipe page to the main homepage  
- Scroll and compare recipes quickly  
- Browse content without page reloads
